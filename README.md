Introduction to C++ for particle physicists
===========================================

A short programming course written by W. H. Bell [ http://www.whbell.net/ ]

Description
-----------

The C++ language is introduced through a series of example programs relevant to high energy physicists. 
The course introduces basic syntax, object orientated programming, the Standard Template Library, 
interfacing with FORTRAN and high energy packages HepMC, HepPDT, and ROOT. Programming skills and design 
proccesses are introduced within the discussion of the example programs. The understanding of C++ 
programming concepts is tested through set problems, for which associated solutions are provided.

This repository contains the course guide, worked examples, problems and associated solutions.
